# [random](http://jeffreymeng.github.io/random)
Random is a project for all things random. Random will have many features when it is complete,  but for now, you can try the random name selector.
 When it is complete, you can also use the random api to do everything random in javascript with just one or two lines of code.
 See random at [http:/jeffreymeng.github.io/random](http://jeffreymeng.github.io/random).
